# SammyShop

SammyShop is a Java CLI Application that is meant to represent a POS system that allows our user to 
create an order to which they can add sandwiches, drinks, and chips. It allows the user to fully customize and place
their order on the app. It shows our order back to us along with the total which then creates a receipt file so that we 
as the shop can keep track of what orders have been made. This system can be altered to any sandwich shop and can become 
a much larger mobile or webapp.

## Favorite Code Snippet

Although a small in lines the checkToppings() method is my favorite code block.
Before adding this I had my toppings list and my checkout screen cluttered with repeated toppings of the same name.
Thanks to this the clutter on screen is reduced to a clean one time only display of the toppings when checking out and 
writing to our receipt file. This method simply checks if the topping selected has already been added to our sandwich
and then simply replaces that element with the same toppings only with "(Extra)" appended. It is a simple workaround 
to letting the user know they ordered the toppings more than once without adding multiple of the same to our list.
